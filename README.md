ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bazzzzil - also known as Layale :)

I'm a product manager in the business world, but in a previous life I was a physicist and a (short-lived) data scientist.

You can find some old code of mine in the repositories on my profile. 
Most are code I wrote during my studies, but some are hobbies of mine to better understand neural networks.

bazzzzil/bazzzzil is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
